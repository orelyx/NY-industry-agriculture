Currently, in research on relating driving behaviour with emissions, driving cycles that are assumed to be constant regardless of vehicle type for a specific area are used to analyse emissions. However, a more realistic model of driving behaviour would enable better estimation of such emissions which can consequently be used to support decision making and policy design.},

For the Phase 2 rulemaking, significant enhancements were made to the model. In addition to the model released with the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), additional refinements were made to the model based on public comments received from our NPRM and subsequent Notice of Data Availability (NODA) releases. This User Guide describes the Phase 2 GEM release, GEM P2v3.5, published with the Phase 2 technical amendment (TA). The following sections include installation instructions, a general model description, and instructions for running the model, including a description of the necessary input and resulting output files. A more detailed description of the model architecture and updates, including changes made in each release are available in the docket associated with each release, particularly in Chapter 4 of the Phase 2 RIA.},

  abstract = {A national level travel demand model for heavy freight trucks was created to determine the effects of these vehicles on national air quality. A commodity-based freight flow model was created from various data sources to estimate national county-level freight flows. The flows were then converted to truck trips through the use of payload factors determined from the VIUS database. Finally, the truck trips were assigned to a national highway network and heavy freight vehicle VMT was determined on the county level. The model performance was evaluated against both the results for another national level model, the Freight Analysis Framework, and against actual vehicle count data. The estimated truck activity characteristics were then input to a freight truck emissions model to evaluate the air quality impacts of freight trucking. The model represents a new method for the development of freight truck travel demand models by using actual truck travel characteristics to fit the results of the gravity model procedure. This represents a useful advance in working around the lack of trip distribution data in the field of freight activity and air quality modeling.},

  abstract = {Last year, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) developed a bottom-up, global aviation inventory to better understand carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from commercial aviation in 2018. This report updates the operations and emissions analyses for calendar year 2018 based on improved source data, and includes new analyses for 2013 and 2019. In 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) requested its technical experts develop a global CO emissions standard for 2aircraft, and states began to submit voluntary action plans to reduce CO2 emissions from aviation. This paper details a global, transparent, and geographically allocated CO2 inventory for three years of commercial aviation, using operations data from OAG Aviation Worldwide Limited, ICAO, individual airlines, and the Piano aircraft emissions modeling software. Our Global Aviation Carbon Assessment (GACA) model estimated CO2 emissions from global passenger and cargo operations on par with totals reported by industry (Figure ES-1). In all three analyzed years, passenger flights were responsible for approximately 85\% of commercial aviation CO2 emissions. In 2019, this amounted to 785 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2. Between 2013 and 2019, passenger transport-related CO2 emissions increased 33\%. Over the same period, the number of flight departures increased 22\% and revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) increased 50\%. This means that passenger air traffic increased nearly four times faster than fuel efficiency improved.},

  abstract = {The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) evaluated the performance of diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), and hybrid electric (equipped with BAE Systems’ HybriDrive propulsion system) transit buses at New York City Transit (NYCT). CNG, Gen I and Gen II hybrid electric propulsion systems were compared on fuel economy, maintenance and operating costs per mile, and reliability. These comparisons are based upon comparable service years; the second year in service for CNG and Gen II hybrids, and the second and third years in service for the Gen I hybrids. Conventional diesel buses provided a baseline comparison for fuel economy. Both the CNG and hybrid propulsion systems are alternatives to standard diesel buses and allow for reductions in petroleum use and emissions (usually focused on reductions of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen). The Gen I hybrid buses exhibited 88\% and 37\% higher fuel economy than CNG and conventional diesel buses, respectively. The average fuel economy for the Gen II hybrid buses was 5.9\% lower than the Gen I hybrid buses. Fuel economy decreased for all bus groups during summer operation due to air conditioning load. However, the hybrids exhibited the most dramatic seasonal fluctuation. The average total maintenance cost per mile for the Gen II hybrid buses was 39\% lower than the Gen I hybrid buses, while the CNG buses’ average was 5\% higher than the Gen I hybrid buses. Total propulsion-related systems maintenance costs per mile were 55\% lower for the Gen II hybrid buses than the Gen I hybrid buses, while the CNG buses were 5\% lower than the Gen I hybrid buses. The Gen I hybrids experienced a 4.8\% traction battery failure rate per year during evaluation year 1, and a 3.3\% failure rate per year during evaluation year 2. BAE Systems utilizes lead-acid chemistry Hawker batteries. Hybrid buses are expected to have reduced brake reline frequency because they use regenerative braking. The Gen I hybrid buses accumulated more than two times the mileage of the CNG buses before requiring their first brake reline.},

The driving cycle was obtained by measurement during normal driving conditions. The results indicated that both parallel and dual-mode hybrid powertrains were capable of improving fuel economy by 7\% to 8\%. However, there was no significant fuel economy benefit for the series hybrid truck because of internal inefficiencies in energy exchange. When reduced aerodynamic drag and tire rolling resistance were combined with hybridization, there was a synergistic fuel economy benefit for appropriate hybrids that increased the fuel economy benefit to more than 15\%. Long-haul hybrid trucks with reduced aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance offered lower peak engine loads, better kinetic energy recovery, and reduced average engine power demand. Thus, it is expected that hybridization with load reduction technologies offers important potential fuel energy savings for future long-haul trucks.},

To reduce CO2 emissions in the future, transportation policy makers are planning on making vehicles more efficient and increasing the use of carbon-neutral alternative fuels. In addition, CO2 emissions can be lowered by improving traffic operations, specifically through the reduction of traffic congestion. Traffic congestion and its impact on CO2 emissions were examined by using detailed energy and emission models, and they were linked to real-world driving patterns and traffic conditions. With typical traffic conditions in Southern California as an example, it was found that CO2 emissions could be reduced by up to almost 20\% through three different strategies: congestion mitigation strategies that reduce severe congestion, allowing traffic to flow at better speeds; speed management techniques that reduce excessively high free-flow speeds to more moderate conditions; and shock wave suppression techniques that eliminate the acceleration and deceleration events associated with the stop-and-go traffic that exists during congested conditions.},

Our central estimate of the elasticity of scrappage with respect to vehicle prices is -0.4, which is substantially different than values adopted in simulation models. These estimates imply that many policies aimed at reducing gasoline consumption, including Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards and gasoline taxes may produce changes in the used vehicle market that are different than prior studies suggest. We also note that consumer scrappage behavior seems to respond more strongly to changes in vehicle price than changes in gasoline price than standard theory would predict.},

The testing and analysis also investigated the sensitivity of the vehicle’s powertrain architecture (i.e., conventional internal combustion powertrain, hybrid electric, or all-electric) on the magnitude of the impact of vehicle mass. The three vehicles used in testing are a 2012 Ford Fusion V6, a 2012 Ford Fusion Hybrid, and a 2011 Nissan Leaf. Testing included coastdown testing on a test track to determine the drag forces and road load at each test weight for each vehicle. Many quality measures were used to ensure only mass variations impact the road load measurements. Chassis dynamometer testing was conducted over standard drive cycles on each vehicle at multiple test weights to determine the fuel consumption or electrical energy consumption impact caused by change in vehicle mass. The road load measurements obtained from the coastdown testing were used to configure the chassis dynamometer. Chassis dynamometer testing also incorporated many quality controls to ensure accurate results.},

All-electric buses are here, and they’re cleaner, healthier and save money for transit agencies, school districts and bus contractors to run in the long-term.  To accelerate the adoption of electric buses, we recommend that:  Cities, transit agencies, and school districts commit to transitioning to 100\% all-electric buses by 2030, with a plan to phase out the purchase of new diesel buses immediately.  Cities, transit agencies, and school districts use traditional financing methods like municipal bonds and local option transportation taxes to finance the purchase of new electric buses. Cities, transit agencies, and school districts partner with local utilities to obtain beneficial rate structures to help save on charging costs and work with utilities to secure charging infrastructure investments. Cities, transit agencies, and school districts take advantage of existing federal, regional, state, and local grant and incentive programs to lower the initial purchase price of electric buses. States increase funding available for the purchase of electric buses through new grant and incentive programs, like CARB’s grant and incentive programs, and explore using a cap-and-trade policy to generate revenue for clean transportation.},

  abstract = {Production of woody biomass for bioenergy, whether wood pellets or liquid biofuels, has the potential to cause substantial landscape change and concomitant effects on forest ecosystems, but the landscape effects of alternative production scenarios have not been fully assessed. We simulated landscape change from 2010 to 2050 under five scenarios of woody biomass production for wood pellets and liquid biofuels in North Carolina, in the southeastern United States, a region that is a substantial producer of wood biomass for bioenergy and contains high biodiversity. Modeled scenarios varied biomass feedstocks, incorporating harvest of ‘conventional’ forests, which include naturally regenerating as well as planted forests that exist on the landscape even without bioenergy production, as well as purpose-grown woody crops grown on marginal lands. Results reveal trade-offs among scenarios in terms of overall forest area and the characteristics of the remaining forest in 2050. Meeting demand for biomass from conventional forests resulted in more total forest land compared with a baseline, business-as-usual scenario. However, the remaining forest was composed of more intensively managed forest and less of the bottomland hardwood and longleaf pine habitats that support biodiversity. Converting marginal forest to purpose-grown crops reduced forest area, but the remaining forest contained more of the critical habitats for biodiversity. Conversion of marginal agricultural lands to purpose-grown crops resulted in smaller differences from the baseline scenario in terms of forest area and the characteristics of remaining forest habitats. Each scenario affected the dominant type of land-use change in some regions, especially in the coastal plain that harbors high levels of biodiversity. Our results demonstrate the complex landscape effects of alternative bioenergy scenarios, highlight that the regions most likely to be affected by bioenergy production are also critical for biodiversity, and point to the challenges associated with evaluating bioenergy sustainability.},

A key element of this action plan will be a Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which will provide rigorously-derived estimates of the current levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the region to serve as a basis for goal-setting and advancing the region's renewable energy transition. This paper reports progress in preparation of a Greenhouse Gas Inventory for the industrial and agricultural sectors of the regional economy, which are probably responsible for about 15 to 25\% of the region's total greenhouse gase emissions. A dataset from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides detailed breakdowns of US energy use by county and industry sector, which are analyzed to generate energy use profiles for the region. The US Environmental Protection Agency has published a set of emission factors for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from energy use; these are used to estimate and analyze greenhouse gas emissions from industry and agriculture across the region.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the critical contribution of the industry sector to long-term decarbonisation, efficiency and renewable energy policy targets. Its methodological novelty is the incorporation of a process-oriented modelling approach based on a comprehensive technology database for the industry sector in a national energy system model for the UK (UKTM), allowing quantification of the role of both decarbonisation of upstream energy vectors and of mitigation options in the industrial sub-categories. This enhanced model is then applied in a comparative policy scenario analysis that explores various target dimensions on emission mitigation, renewable energy and energy efficiency at both a national and European level. The results show that ambitious emission cuts in the industry sector of up to 77\% until 2050 compared to 2010 can be achieved. Moreover, with a reduction in industrial energy demand of up to 31\% between 2010 and 2050, the sector is essential for achieving the overall efficiency commitments. The industry sector also makes a moderate contribution to the expansion of renewable energies mostly through the use of biomass for low-temperature heating services. However, additional sub-targets on renewable sources and energy efficiency need to be assessed critically, as they can significantly distort the cost-efficiency of the long-term mitigation pathway.},

  abstract = {The new Belgian CAr Stock MOdel, which is linked to the national transport demand model PLANET, is structured as follows: (a) The total desired car stock in each future year is a function of the country's population and GDP per capita. (b) The probability that a car is scrapped is modelled as a function of its age and accumulated mileage. The desired car stock is then confronted with the remaining car stock to determine total car purchases. (c) Total sales are allocated to individual emission classes, using the parameter values of a Stated Preference discrete choice model. The model is then calibrated in order to reflect the current market and policy context in Belgium (d) The results are mapped into an inventory that is aggregated according to the EURO emission class. (e) In order to represent that the non-price barriers to electrified cars will decrease over time, we have implemented an alternative approach where the perceived acquisition costs decrease over time. Alternatively, this approach can be used to explore what would be the required decrease in subjective costs to reach a given future market share.},

  date = {2013-01-22},
  abstract = {The MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is capable of estimating project level on road vehicle emission rates for a wide variety of driving cycles. Many researchers and practitioners seek to combine MOVES with travel demand models (TDMs) and traffic simulation models (TSMs) to estimate emissions impacts of possible changes in road infrastructure, vehicle mix, traffic control measures, and other factors. However, MOVES is computationally intensive. To facilitate the capability to estimate link-based emission factors based on vehicle speed trajectories, a simplified version of MOVES is demonstrated here. A Cycle Correction Factor (CCF) is generated for a selected vehicle type and driving cycle based on distribution of time spent in each of 23 MOVES operating mode bins. These modes are defined by instantaneous speed and Vehicle Specific Power (VSP). Emission factors estimated by the simplified model are sensitive to differences between driving cycles with similar average speeds. The simplified model cycle average predictions are within ±1\% of those from MOVES for 92\% of pollutants, ages, driving cycles, and vehicle types for CO2, CO, NOx, and HC, vehicle ages of 0 to 20 years, 11 to 18 driving cycles per vehicle type, and passenger cars, passenger trucks, light commercial trucks, single unit short haul trucks, and combination long haul trucks. The simplified model is demonstrated based on empirical driving cycles from field measurements.},

The methodology was applied to the Cessna Citation X business aircraft, for which the aircraft flight manual and the flight crew operating manual are available. In addition, another data source based on computerized trajectory was also used to generate several climb and descent flight profiles required in the engine model identification process. To demonstrate and further validate the accuracy of the proposed engine performance model, a level-D research aircraft flight simulator of the Cessna Citation X was used as a reference. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA, AC 120-40B), level D corresponds to the highest qualification level for the flight dynamics and engine modeling. Validation of the methodology was accomplished by comparing the prediction model with a series of flight data collected with the flight simulator for different flight conditions and different flight phases including takeoff, climb, cruise, and idle descent. Comparison results were validated with a tolerance of ±5\% for each engine performance predicted by the model in terms of fan speed, core speed, thrust, and fuel flow.},

  abstract = {Aviation emissions have been found to cause 5\% of global anthropogenic radiative forcing and ∼16 000 premature deaths annually due to impaired air quality. When aiming to reduce these impacts, decision makers often face trade-offs between different emission species or impacts in different times and locations. To inform rational decision-making, this study computes aviation’s marginal climate and air quality impacts per tonne of species emitted and accounts for the altitude, location, and chemical composition of emissions. Climate impacts are calculated using a reduced-order climate model, and air quality-related health impacts are quantified using marginal atmospheric sensitivities to emissions from the adjoint of the global chemistry-transport model GEOS-Chem in combination with concentration response functions and the value of statistical life. The results indicate that 90\% of the global impacts per unit of fuel burn are attributable to cruise emissions, and that 64\% of all damages are the result of air quality impacts. Furthermore, nitrogen oxides (NO x ), carbon dioxide (CO2), and contrails are collectively responsible for 97\% of the total impact. Applying our result metrics to an example, we find that a 20\% NOx stringency scenario for new aircraft would reduce the net atmospheric impacts by 700 m USD during the first year of operation, even if the NO x emission reductions cause a small increase in CO2 emissions of 2\%. In such a way, the damage metrics can be used to rapidly evaluate the atmospheric impacts of market growth as well as emissions trade-offs of aviation-related policies or technology improvements.},

The test set-up included three different pavements (one granite and two quartzite with different aggregate sizes), three different tyre types (studded, non-studded, and summer tyres) and different speeds (30–70kmh−1). The results show that the granite pavement was more prone to PM10 production compared to the quartzite pavements. Studded winter tyres yield tens of times higher PM10 concentrations compared to non-studded winter tyres. Wear from summer tyres was negligible in comparison. It was also shown that wear is strongly dependent on speed; every 10kmh−1 increase yielded an increase of the PM10 concentration of 680μgm−3 in one of the simulator experiments.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are widely regarded as a promising solution to reduce air pollution in cities and key to a low carbon mobility future. However, their environmental benefits depend on the temporal and spatial context of actual usage (journey energy efficiency) and the rolling out of EVs is complicated by issues such as limited range. This paper explores how the energy efficiency of EVs is affected and shaped by driving behavior, personal driving styles, traffic conditions, and infrastructure design in the real world. Tests have been conducted with a Nissan LEAF under a typical driving cycle on the Beijing road network in order to improve understanding of variations in energy efficiency among drivers under different urban traffic conditions. Energy consumption and operation parameters were recorded in both peak and off-peak hours for a total of 13 drivers. The analysis reported in this paper shows that there are clear patterns in energy consumption along a route that are in part related to differences in infrastructure design, traffic conditions, and personal driving styles. The proposed method for analyzing time series data about energy consumption along routes can be used for research with larger fleets of EVs in the future.},

Various federal agencies use the Waybill Sample as part of their informational and decision-making framework, and many states use it as a source of information for developing state transportation plans. STB creates the Public Use Waybill file from the confidential Waybill Sample file. See the attached documents for more information. The "Reference Guide" document contains additional details on the variables and Standard Transportation Commodity Codes (STCC).

ALPHA is a physics-based, forward-looking, full vehicle computer simulation capable of analyzing various vehicle types with different powertrain technologies, showing realistic vehicle behavior, and auditing of all internal energy flows in the model. The software tool is a MATLAB/Simulink based desktop application. In preparation for the midterm evaluation of the light-duty GHG emission standards for model years 2022-2025, EPA is refining and revalidating ALPHA using newly acquired data from model year 2013-2015 engines and vehicles. From its database of engine and vehicle benchmarking data EPA identified the most efficient, engines, transmissions and vehicle technologies, and then used ALPHA to model a midsized car incorporating combinations of these existing technologies which minimize GHG emissions. In a similar analysis, ALPHA was used to estimate the GHG emissions from future low-GHG technology packages potentially available in model year 2025. This paper presents the ALPHA model inputs, results and the lessons learned during this modeling and assessment activity.},

The powertrain types to be assessed include naturally aspirated gasoline engines, turbocharged gasoline engines, diesel engines, electric hybrids using gasoline engines and advanced transmissions. Advancements in aerodynamics, weight reduction and tire rolling friction are also taken into account. The basis for the comparison is the potential of these powertrain technologies for reduction of oil consumption and green house gas emissions at the same level of performance as current vehicles. The fuel consumption and performance of future vehicles was estimated using simple scaling laws and vehicle simulations. The results indicate that the potential for reduction of fuel consumption is significant for all the powertrains examined. More specifically, it seems that the current relative advantage of diesel over gasoline engines in terms of fuel consumption is reduced. Future turbocharged gasoline engines especially, seem to become almost equivalent with diesel engines.},

The surveys were segmented by registration, geography, vehicle type, and vehicle age, and the data collection effort exceeded sampling targets across almost all segments. The CA-VIUS is the largest statewide commercial vehicle data collection effort in the United States and will replace the 2002 National VIUS in transportation planning and emissions studies throughout California. Currently, the wealth of information provided by the survey is supporting the development of the California Statewide Freight Forecasting Model which is a fine-grained behavioral freight model. This model will allow California Department of Transportation and its partners to make more informed infrastructure and operational investment decisions. The CA-VIUS data will also be useful for researchers and practitioners hoping to understand the impacts and benefits of commercial vehicle movements on air quality, economic activity, safety, and vehicle usage. This paper documents key sampling and survey approaches, but mainly focuses on the key findings observed in the survey. This is a practical paper geared towards practitioners who are seeking to analyze a new VIUS survey and those who wish to implement one of their own.},

At typical temperature and solar conditions simulating different life cycle stages (i.e., storage, paving, and use), common road and roofing asphalts produced complex mixtures of organic compounds, including hazardous pollutants. Chemically speciated emission factors using high-resolution mass spectrometry reveal considerable oxygen and reduced sulfur content and the predominance of aromatic (\textasciitilde 30\%) and intermediate/semivolatile organic compounds (\textasciitilde 85\%), which together produce high overall secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields. Emissions rose markedly with moderate solar exposure (e.g., 300\% for road asphalt) with greater SOA yields and sustained SOA production. On urban scales, annual estimates of asphalt-related SOA precursor emissions exceed those from motor vehicles and substantially increase existing estimates from noncombustion sources. Yet, their emissions and impacts will be concentrated during the hottest, sunniest periods with greater photochemical activity and SOA production. Laboratory and field observations of organic compound emissions reveal a previously unknown source of reactive pollution precursors.

  abstract = {The saturation of the airspace around current airports combined with increasingly stringent community noise limits represents a serious impediment to growth in world aviation travel. Breakthrough concepts that both increase throughput and reduce noise impacts are required to enable growth in aviation markets. Concepts with a 25 year horizon must facilitate a 4x increase in air travel while simultaneously meeting community noise constraints. Attacking these horizon issues holistically is the concept study of a Cruise Efficient Short Take-Off and Landing (CESTOL) high subsonic transport under the NASA's Revolutionary Systems Concepts for Aeronautics (RSCA) project. The concept is a high-lift capable airframe with a partially embedded distributed propulsion system that takes a synergistic approach in propulsion-airframe-integration (PAI) by fully integrating the airframe and propulsion systems to achieve the benefits of both low-noise short take-off and landing (STOL) operations and efficient high speed cruise. This paper presents a summary of the recent study of a distributed propulsion/airframe configuration that provides low-noise STOL operation to enable 24-hour use of the untapped regional and city center airports to increase the capacity of the overall airspace while still maintaining efficient high subsonic cruise flight capability.}

This paper reports progess in preparation of a Greenhouse Gas Inventory for the industrial and agricultural sectors of the regional economy, which are probably responsible for about 20 to 30\% of the region’s total greenhouse gase emissions. A dataset from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides detailed breakdowns of US energy use by county and industry sector, which are analyzed to generate energy use profiles for the region. The US Environmental Protection Agency has published a set of emission factors for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from energy use; these are used to estimate and analyze greenhouse gas emissions from industry and agriculture across the region.},

The simulation models of the different powertrains were developed in the Autonomie vehicle simulation software. The carbon dioxide emissions were calculated both for the bus operation and for the fuel and energy pathways from well to tank. Two different operating environment case scenarios were used for the primary energy sources, which were Finland and California (USA). The fuel and energy pathways were selected appropriately in relation to the operating environment. The lifecycle costs take into account the purchase, operating, maintenance, and possible carbon emission costs. Based on the simulation results, the energy efficiency of city buses can be significantly improved by the alternative powertrain technologies. Hybrid buses have moderately lower carbon dioxide emissions during the service life than diesel buses whereas fully-electric buses have potential to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, by up to 75\%. The lifecycle cost analysis indicates that diesel hybrid buses are already competitive with diesel and natural gas buses. The high costs of fuel cell and battery systems are the major challenges for the fuel cell hybrid buses in order to reduce lifecycle costs to more competitive levels.},

  abstract = {Aviation emissions contribute to the radiative forcing (RF) of climate. Of importance are emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), aerosols and their precursors (soot and sulphate), and increased cloudiness in the form of persistent linear contrails and induced-cirrus cloudiness. The recent Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) quantified aviation's RF contribution for 2005 based upon 2000 operations data. Aviation has grown strongly over the past years, despite world-changing events in the early 2000s; the average annual passenger traffic growth rate was 5.3\% yr−1 between 2000 and 2007, resulting in an increase of passenger traffic of 38\%. Presented here are updated values of aviation RF for 2005 based upon new operations data that show an increase in traffic of 22.5\%, fuel use of 8.4\% and total aviation RF of 14\% (excluding induced-cirrus enhancement) over the period 2000–2005. The lack of physical process models and adequate observational data for aviation-induced cirrus effects limit confidence in quantifying their RF contribution. Total aviation RF (excluding induced cirrus) in 2005 was ∼55~mW~m−2 (23–87~mW~m−2, 90\% likelihood range), which was 3.5\% (range 1.3–10\%, 90\% likelihood range) of total anthropogenic forcing. Including estimates for aviation-induced cirrus RF increases the total aviation RF in 2005–78~mW~m−2 (38–139~mW~m−2, 90\% likelihood range), which represents 4.9\% of total anthropogenic forcing (2–14\%, 90\% likelihood range). Future scenarios of aviation emissions for 2050 that are consistent with IPCC SRES A1 and B2 scenario assumptions have been presented that show an increase of fuel usage by factors of~2.7–3.9 over 2000. Simplified calculations of total aviation RF in 2050 indicate increases by factors of 3.0–4.0 over the 2000 value, representing 4–4.7\% of total RF (excluding induced cirrus). An examination of a range of future technological options shows that substantive reductions in aviation fuel usage are possible only with the introduction of radical technologies. Incorporation of aviation into an emissions trading system offers the potential for overall (i.e., beyond the aviation sector) CO2 emissions reductions. Proposals exist for introduction of such a system at a European level, but no agreement has been reached at a global level.},

Air travel continuous to experience the fastest growth of all modes of transport, and although the energy intensity of the aviation transport system continues to decline, fuel use and total emissions have steadily risen. This trend, which represents a conflict between growth and environmental impact, has motivated the aircraft manufacturing and airline industries, the scientific community, and governmental bodies to consider what pace of emissions reduction is acceptable. This paper analyzes the historical influence of aircraft performance on cost to examine the potential pace of future efficiency improvements and emissions reduction. Technological and operational influences on aircraft energy intensity are quantified and correlated with direct operating cost and aircraft price using analytical and statistical models built upon historical data for US airlines. The energy intensity reduction potential and economic characteristics of future aircraft are also projected, through extrapolations of historical trends in aircraft technology and operations.},

A simplified version of MOVES, referred to as "MOVES Lite," was developed that can estimate the same values for emission factors as MOVES but is intended to enable rapid quantification of driving schedule average emission rates. The applicability of MOVES Lite to several driving schedules was illustrated via a case study based on over 200 empirical driving cycles. The simplified model estimated accurate emission factors for various driving cycles, vehicle types, ages, and pollutants. The runtime was significantly improved by 3,000 times compared with MOVES. As part of ongoing work, MOVES Lite will be incorporated with a traffic simulation model and applied to case studies to estimate the relative change and emissions as a result of a modification of transportation infrastructure, operations, or both.

  abstract = {The California Air Resources Board's emissions inventory estimates indicate that ambient air quality in several regions of California is substantially affected by the exhaust emissions of diesel trucks. There are insufficient data to accurately model the energy and emissions impacts of interstate-traveling trucks, many of which may be registered and/or fuel out-of-state. Emissions inventory estimates are based on adjustments to data on California-registered trucks. These estimates may not reflect the effect of non-California-registered trucks' attributes and operations. Further, the effects of out-of-state fueling by California-registered and non-California-registered interstate-traveling trucks are also not currently captured. In Summer 2006, an interview survey of 433 truck drivers was conducted to characterize the vehicle attributes and operations of interstate trucks that travel in California. We estimate that non-California-registered trucks account for more than one-quarter of the Class 8 heavy-duty truck mileage on California roads. Also more than one-quarter of all Class 8 heavy-duty truck mileage in California is fueled by out-of-state diesel. The effects of this are disproportionately concentrated in four air basins â€“ the Mojave Desert, South Coast, the Sacramento Valley, and the San Joaquin Valley â€“ with considerable ambient air quality issues.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that the role of electric buses in public transit is important if we are to take steps to reduce climate change and the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. Several electric alternatives are currently operationalized, and the debate about which is most suitable is attracting considerable attention. This article provides a detailed review of various performance features for three categories of electric buses: hybrid, fuel cell, and battery. Economic, operational, energy, and environmental characteristics of each technology are reviewed in detail based on simulation models and operational data presented by various scholars in different contexts. The study develops a holistic assessment of electric buses based on side-by-side comparison of 16 features that best inform the decision making process. The review indicates that the selection process of electric technology is highly sensitive to operational context and energy profile. In addition, it highlights that hybrid buses will not provide a significant reduction in GHG and would be suitable only for short-term objectives as a stepping-stone towards full electrification of transit. Battery and fuel cell buses are arguably capable of satisfying the current operational requirements, yet initial investment remains a major barrier. Overnight Battery Electric Bus is advocated as the most suitable alternative for bus transit contexts given the expected improvements in battery technology and the trend to utilize sustainable sources in electricity generation.},

  abstract = {Wastewater treatment facilities, both industrial and municipal, are often subject to state air permitting and annual emission reporting requirements. Additionally, Federal and state regulatory agencies scrutinize emissions to the air from wastewater treatment facilities. In each of these conditions, air permitting, emission reporting, or responding to regulatory agency requests for information, quantification of pollutant emissions to the air is required. Emission sources of concern at wastewater treatment facilities typically include gas combustion (e.g. digester gas flares or engines), material handling, and fugitive emissions from wastewater treatment operations. Quantification of emissions from combustion and material handling processes is relatively straightforward; emission calculations are typically performed using published emission factors, equipment manufacturer's guarantees, or facility specific stack testing results. Quantification of emissions from wastewater treatment units is more complex, with variability in influent composition and flow rate along with a wide variety of different treatment units each with its own emission characteristics. Typically, characterization of influent water composition and treatment unit parameters must be used with an emision model to quantify emissions from wastewater treatment units. There are several choices for modeling emissions from wastewater treatment units. Some of the more common choices include the WATER9 model, the TOXCHEM model, equations found in AP-42, or Pooled Emission Estimation Program (PEEP) emission factors. This paper provides a description of these models, a discussion of how they can be used, and considerations for model selection.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have a limited driving range compared to conventional vehicles. Accurate estimation of EV's range is therefore a significant need to eliminate “range anxiety” that refers to drivers' fear of running out of energy while driving. However, the range estimators used in the currently available EVs are not sufficiently accurate. To overcome this issue, more accurate range estimation techniques are investigated. Nonetheless, an accurate power-based EV energy consumption model is crucial to obtain a precise range estimation. This paper describes a study on EV energy consumption modelling. For this purpose, EV modelling is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink software based on a real EV in the market, the BMW i3. The EV model includes vehicle powertrain system and longitudinal vehicle dynamics. The powertrain is modelled using efficiency maps of the electric motor and the power electronics' data available for BMW i3. It also includes a transmission and a battery model (ie, Thevenin equivalent circuit model). A driver model is developed as well to control the vehicle's speed and to represent human driver's behaviour. In addition, a regenerative braking strategy, based on a series brake system, is developed to model the behaviour of a real braking controller. Auxiliary devices are also included in the EV model to improve energy consumption estimation accuracy as they can have a significant impact on that. The vehicle model is validated against published energy consumption values that demonstrates a satisfactory level of accuracy with 2\% to 6\% error between simulation and experimental results for Environmental Protection Agency and NEDC tests.},

Given the potential for future increases in crude oil prices, as well as environmental costs (i.e. from cap and trade schemes or taxes), the effective cost of aviation fuel may continue to increase, further impacting airlines’ financial performance and the provision of air service nationwide. We evaluate how fuel price increase and volatility affected continental US air transportation networks and fleets in the short- and medium-term using the increase in the 2007-08 and 2004-08 periods as a natural experiment. It was found that non-hub airports serving small communities lost 12\% of connections, compared to an average loss of 2.8\%, July 2004-08. It is believed that reduced access to the national air transportation system had social and economic impacts for small communities. Complementary analyses of aircraft fuel efficiency, airline economics, and airfares provided a basis for understanding some airline decisions. Increased effective fuel costs will provide incentives for airlines to improve fleet fuel efficiency, reducing the environmental effects of aviation, but may cause an uneven distribution of social and economic impacts as airline networks adapt. Government action may be required to determine acceptable levels of access to service as the air transportation system transitions to higher fuel costs.},

Regardless, some changes were introduced in this updated analysis when needed. In this revision, we find that passenger cars and light trucks are being driven farther in their lifetimes (approximately 26,000 miles more per vehicle class). However, whereas younger passenger cars (less than 20 years old) are surviving slightly longer relative to the previous study, light trucks are not surviving as long as before early on in their existence, presumably due to the fact that they are being used more often as passenger vehicles than strictly for cargo.},

  abstract = {Liquid fuel consumption by medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) represents 26 percent of all U.S. liq- uid transportation fuels consumed and has increased more rapidly—in both absolute and percentage terms—than consumption by other sectors. In early recognition of these trends, which are forecast to continue until 2035 (DOE, EIA, 2009), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; Public Law 110-140, Dec. 19, 2007), Section 108, was passed, requiring the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), for the first time in history, to establish fuel economy standards for MHDVs. In December 2009 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally declared that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions endanger public health and the environment within the meaning of the Clean Air Act, a decision that compels EPA to consider establishing first-ever GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles, including MHDVs. If the United States is to reduce its reliance on foreign sources of oil, and reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector, it is important to consider how the fuel consumption of MHDVs can be reduced.  Following the passage of EISA, the National Research Council appointed the Committee to Assess Fuel Economy Technologies for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles. The committee considered approaches to measuring fuel economy (the committee uses fuel consumption), assessed current and future technologies for reducing fuel consumption, addressed how such technologies may be practically implemented in vehicles, discussed the pros and cons of approaches to improving the fuel efficiency of moving goods as opposed to setting vehicle fuel consumption standards, and identified potential costs and other impacts on the operation of MHDVs (see Chapter 1 and Appendix A for the complete statement of task).},

  abstract = {New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) requires an unprecedented transformation of the State’s electricity grid to achieve 70\% renewable generation by 2030, zero-emission electricity by 2040, and an 85\% economy-wide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2050. The CLCPA specifies minimum amounts of certain types of resources, including 6,000 MW of distributed solar resources by 2025, 3,000 MW of storage by 2030, and 9,000 MW of offshore wind (OSW) generation by 2035. Even greater quantities of various types of renewable generation are necessary to achieve the clean energy mandates for 2040 and 2050. Meeting these milestones will require investment in renewable generation, as well as storage, energy efficiency measures, electrification of the transportation and heating sectors, and electric transmission and distribution (T\&D) infrastructure. T\&D infrastructure will play a critical role in meeting the State’s goals by connecting new renewable resources to the grid and transmitting and delivering energy to consumers. Accordingly, the recently enacted Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act directs the Public Service Commission (PSC) to advance the work of identifying T\&D upgrades needed to reliably and cost-effectively integrate the required renewable resources, and to establish planning processes to support cost-effective and timely infrastructure development. To meet these directives, the PSC, through the Department of Public Service, initiated a set of system studies, collectively referred to as the Power Grid Study (PGS), which is the subject of this Initial Report. The PGS consists of three components, each of which is included in this Report: – A study conducted by the Joint Utilities1 on local transmission and distribution (LT\&D) needs (Utility Study); – A study of offshore and onshore bulk-power transmission infrastructure scenarios, and related environmental permitting considerations, to illustrate possible solutions to integrate the mandated 9,000 MW of offshore wind (OSW generation by 2035, sponsored by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and conducted by DNV-GL, PowerGem, and WSP (OSW Study) – A state-wide scenario-based study to analyze transmission, generation, and storage options for achieving 70\% renewable generation by 2030 and a zero emissions grid by 2040, sponsored by NYSERDA and conducted by Siemens (Zero Emissions Study).},

  abstract = {A wind tunnel investigation is conducted to evaluate the performance of both commerciallyavailable and prototype aerodynamic drag reduction devices for modern class 8 heavy vehicles. Drag force measurements are made on three full-scale, heavy vehicle configurations at a Reynolds number of 4.6× 10 based upon the vehicle width. The wind-averaged drag coefficient is calculated from the wind tunnel measurements and used to estimate the fuel savings afforded by individual and combinations of devices. For the tractor-trailer gap, the most effective modification is found to be reducing the gap size. Numerous trailer skirts are installed on the three heavy vehicle configurations and the resulting change in the windaveraged drag coefficient is shown to have a nominally linear dependence upon the change in the trailer skirt area. The trailer base drag is alleviated through the installation of boattail devices. When used in combination, the devices often provide a reduction in drag that is greater than the individual contribution from each device. For the best vehicle configurations, the wind-averaged drag coefficient and the resulting estimated fuel use decrease by 0.097 to 0.150 and approximately 10000 to 15000 L per 2.012×10 m of highway mileage driven, respectively.},

Context matters — the same project can have wildly different impacts when rolled out in different places. Utilities, policy makers, and vendors need more than a published study to capture the benefits and consequences of their specific project within its context. The Grid Project Impacts Quantification (GridPIQ) web screening tool aims to incorporate enough detail about specific grid technology and objectives, coupled with enough detail about the system context to yield insight. The focus is on transparency, modularity, ease of use, and versatility rather than precision.

  abstract = {An up to date and accurate aviation emission inventory is a prerequisite for any detailed analysis of aviation emission impact on greenhouse gases and local air quality around airports. In this paper we present an aviation emission inventory using real time air traffic trajectory data. The reported inventory is in the form of a 4D database which provides resolution of 1°×1°×1000ft for temporal and spatial emission analysis. The inventory is for an ongoing period of six months starting from October 2008 for Australian Airspace. In this study we show 6 months of data, with 492,936 flights (inbound, outbound and over flying). These flights used about 2515.83kt of fuel and emitted 114.59kt of HC, 200.95kt of CO, 45.92kt of NOx, 7929.89kt of CO2, and 2.11kt of SOx. From the spatial analysis of emissions data, we found that the CO2 concentration in some parts of Australia is much higher than other parts, especially in some major cities. The emission results also show that NOx emission of aviation may have a significant impact on the ozone layer in the upper troposphere, but not in the stratosphere. It is expected that with the availability of this real time aviation emission database, environmental analysts and aviation experts will have an indispensable source of information for making timely decisions regarding expansion of runways, building new airports, applying route charges based on environmentally congested airways, and restructuring air traffic flow to achieve sustainable air traffic growth.},

On-going evaluations to Phase II occurred over an extended period of time to allow for consideration of chronological impacts to operations and programs, which culminated in a deferred release of this report. This report outlines observations and assessments based on the school district’s status at the time of Phase II and will most certainly need to be adjusted to reflect the current status of operations and programs overall in Phase III.

  abstract = {The electrification of road vehicles was introduced as a way to significantly reduce oil dependence, increase efficiency, and reduce pollutant emissions, especially in urban areas. The goal of this paper is to find the best alternative vehicle to replace a conventional diesel bus operating in urban environments, aiming to reduce the carbon footprint and still being financially advantageous. The multi-objective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is used to perform the vehicle optimization, covering pure electric and fuel cell hybrid possibilities (with and without plug-in capability). The used multi-objective genetic algorithm optimizes the powertrain components (type and size) and the energy management strategy. Although multiple optimal solutions were successfully achieved, a decision method is implemented to select one unique solution. A global criterion approach, a pseudo-weight vector approach, and a new multiple criteria score approach are considered to choose a preferred optimal vehicle. Real and synthetic driving cycles are used to compare the optimized buses concerning their powertrain components, efficiency and life cycle of fuel and vehicle materials. The conflict between objectives and the importance of the decision considerations in the final solutions are discussed. Passengers load and air conditioning system influence in the solutions and its life cycle is addressed.},

  abstract = {Railyard operations involve a variety of complex activities, including inbound and outbound train movements, classification (i.e., separating cars from inbound trains for redirection to multiple destinations, and building new trains), and servicing locomotives. Standard locomotive duty cycles provide long-term average activity patterns for locomotive operations, but they are not appropriate for the specialized activities that occur within railyards or at locations such as ports, and emission densities in such areas can be high relative to those of line haul activities. There are significant emission rate differences between locomotive models, and differences in the types of service for which specific models are used. Data for throttle-specific emissions, activity levels, and locomotive models and operating practices can be used to provide more accurate emissions estimates for such operations. Such data are needed to quantify actual emissions changes in these high activity areas. A calculation scheme has been developed to generate detailed emission inventories based on the types of data that are collected for managing rail operations. This scheme allows improved accuracy in emissions estimation, and also provides a more reliable basis for bottom-up tracking of emissions changes over time. Factors that can be addressed include: changes in the distribution of locomotive models and control technology levels (e.g., increasing fractions of Tier 0, 1, and 2 locomotives) for both line haul and local operations; actual in-yard idling duration and reductions associated with auto-start-stop technologies; fuel quality effects; and detailed operating practices for switching and train-building operations. By providing detailed disaggregation of activity and emissions data, the method also makes it possible to quantify and evaluate the effects of specific emission reduction alternatives.},

The basic principle of these methods is that emissions of the aforementioned combustion products are directly correlated with fuel flow. No internal engine parameters are required for emissions calculation. Given the fuel flow at flight conditions calculated by aircraft performance software, engine emissions of NOx, CO and HC can be estimated. In addition to the actual engine fuel flow, thrust-dependent reference emission indices and fuel flows for sea-level static conditions (available from the ICAO engine emissions databank) and actual ambient conditions including temperature and pressure are required as input data.},

However, in the absence of rigorous analyses assessing the costs for mitigating CO2 emissions, these policies could be economically wasteful. Here we identify the cost-effectiveness of CO2 emission reductions from narrow-body aircraft, the workhorse of passenger air transportation. We find that in the US, a combination of fuel burn reduction strategies could reduce the 2012 level of life cycle CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre by around 2\% per year to mid-century. These intensity reductions would occur at zero marginal costs for oil prices between US\$50–100 per barrel. Even larger reductions are possible, but could impose extra costs and require the adoption of biomass-based synthetic fuels. The extent to which these intensity reductions will translate into absolute emissions reductions will depend on fleet growth.},

By using a worldwide agricultural model to estimate emissions from land-use change, we found that corn-based ethanol, instead of producing a 20\% savings, nearly doubles greenhouse emissions over 30 years and increases greenhouse gases for 167 years. Biofuels from switchgrass, if grown on U.S. corn lands, increase emissions by 50\%. This result raises concerns about large biofuel mandates and highlights the value of using waste products.},

Existing public models used for computing terminal-area airplane fuel consumption have been shown to have substantial errors, potentially leading to erroneous policy and investment decisions. The method of modeling fuel consumption proposed in this paper was developed using data from a major airplane manufacturer. When compared with airline performance/operational data, this proposed method has been shown to accurately predict fuel consumption in the terminal area. The proposed method uses airplane performance data from publicly available environmental models supported by the Federal Aviation Administration and others. The proposed method has sufficient generality to protect the proprietary interests of the manufacturer, while still having adequate fidelity to analyze low-speed airplane operations in the terminal area. This improved methodology will enable more informed decisions by policy-makers seeking to account for the effects of fuel consumption and airplane emissions on plans for future airspace and airport designs.},

We study the market for new transit buses that features a set of non-profit transit agencies purchasing buses primarily from a few domestic bus makers. Unlike private vehicles, the fuel economy of public buses is irresponsive to fuel price changes. To understand this finding, we build a model of bus fleet management decisions of local transit agencies that yields testable hypotheses. Our empirical analysis of bus fleet turnover and capital investment suggests that transit agencies: (1) do not respond to energy prices in either their scrappage or purchase decisions; (2) respond to environmental regulations by scrapping diesel buses earlier and switch to natural gas buses; (3) prefer purchasing buses from manufacturers whose assembly plants are located in the same state; (4) exhibit significant brand loyalty or lock-in effects; (5) favor domestically produced buses when they have access to more federal funding.},

  abstract = {Vehicle scrappage or survival models provide estimates of the fraction of vehicles of each model year that survive to each later year. Earlier studies have suggested that many socioeconomic factors are associated with vehicle scrappage decisions, such as vehicle age, new vehicle price, household income, unemployment rate, used vehicle price, vehicle maintenance and repair cost, and interest rate for new car loans. However, most of the vehicle scrappage models used so far have been quite simple, using either vehicle age or new car price as determinants. The objectives of the research presented were to (a) develop a statistical vehicle scrappage model capable of describing the association between vehicle scrappage rate and a number of potential determinants such as those just suggested, (b) use the developed model to identify socioeconomic factors that may be associated with aggregate car scrappage rate in the United States using historical data and infer a car scrappage model for prediction purposes, and (c) illustrate how the suggested scrappage model can be used to predict car scrappage and survival rates.},

These challenges are exacerbated by a lack of consistent procedural guidance; existing national traffic monitoring guidelines lack sufficient direction and detail for recreational travel. In an effort to improve/lend consistency to traffic monitoring in recreational areas, the Coordinated Technology Implementation Program tasked the Office of Federal Lands Highway-Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) with conducting an assessment of the nationwide practices for recreational traffic data collection. A review of pertinent literature related to recreational traffic data collection was conducted. A targeted survey of various State and local agencies responsible for traffic monitoring was administered. A workshop focused on traffic monitoring in recreational areas was also conducted. Key findings from these activities are briefly described herein.},

  abstract = {The significance of air pollution emissions from airports is growing as airports expand to meet increasing demand for air travel and as the relative contribution of other sources declines under the pressure of progressively more stringent emission control programs. As a result, airports are being targeted for more aggressive emission control programs. Aircraft ground support equipment (GSE) represents one of three groups of mobile emission sources at airports. Together with aircraft and ground access vehicles, GSE contribute a small but significant share of the hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emitted in metropolitan areas. Today, total emissions from these three source categories comprise on the order of 2-3 percent of total manmade emissions in a typical metropolitan area, but this share is expected to increase as air travel continues to grow while emissions from other, non-airport sources are subject to increasingly stringent controls. Since airports represent a growing source of emissions, EPA issued a work assignment to gather information and develop methodologies that can be used to develop a protocol on how to obtain State Implementation Plan (SIP) credit for emission reductions associated with the retrofit/replacement of airport ground support equipment by third parties, or governmental entities. This project is in support of the U.S. EPA Office of Mobile Sources Transportation and Market Incentives Group’s (TMIG) efforts to develop protocols for quantifying voluntary mobile source emissions programs (VMEPs). Voluntary Measure Protocols are stand-alone guidance documents that describe the steps and methodology necessary for states and/or third parties to quantify emission reductions for SIP credit under EPA’s Voluntary Measures Policy. Steps include requirements for quantifying emission benefits and estimating uncertainties in emission reductions and compliance, as well as administrative requirements for record keeping and/or SIP submission.},

  abstract = {Aircraft emissions impact the environment by changing the radiative balance of the atmosphere and impact human health by adversely affecting air quality. Many tools used to quantify aircraft emissions are not open source and in most cases are computationally expensive. This limits their usefulness for studies that require rapid simulation, such as uncertainty quantification and assessment of many policy options. We describe the methods used to develop the open source Aviation Emissions Inventory Code (AEIC) and produce a global emissions inventory for the year 2005 from scheduled civil aviation, with quantified uncertainty. This is the most up-to-date openly available inventory for use in atmospheric modeling studies. We estimate that in 2005, scheduled civil aviation was responsible for 180.6 Tg (90\% CI: 136.1-232.9 Tg) of fuel burn, equating to 155.5 Tg of CO2 as C (90\% CI: 117.3-200.7 Tg) and 0.108 Tg of SOx as S (90\% CI: 0.080-0.142 Tg) emissions. 2.689 Tg of NOx as NO2 (90\% CI: 1.761-3.804 Tg), 0.749 Tg of CO (90\% CI: 0.422-1.145 Tg), and 0.201 Tg of HC as CH4 (90\% CI: 0.072-0.362 Tg) were also emitted. 92\% of fuel burn took place in the northern hemisphere. Landing and takeoff operations were responsible for 9.1\% of total global fuel burn, while 70.6\% of fuel burn occurred above 8 km. Our total fuel burn estimate agrees within 4\% of other published emissions inventories for the years 2004 and 2006, which is within the uncertainty range of the analysis.},

  abstract = {The potential adverse human health and climate impacts of emissions from UK airports have become a significant political issue, yet the emissions, air quality impacts and health impacts attributable to UK airports remain largely unstudied. We produce an inventory of UK airport emissions – including aircraft landing and takeoff (LTO) operations and airside support equipment – with uncertainties quantified. The airports studied account for more than 95\% of UK air passengers in 2005. We estimate that in 2005, UK airports emitted 10.2~Gg [−23 to~+29\%] of NOx, 0.73~Gg [−29 to~+32\%] of SO2, 11.7~Gg [−42 to~+77\%] of CO, 1.8~Gg [−59 to~+155\%] of HC, 2.4~Tg [−13 to~+12\%] of CO2, and 0.31~Gg [−36 to~+45\%] of PM2.5. This translates to 2.5~Tg [−12 to~+12\%] CO2-eq using Global Warming Potentials for a 100-year time horizon. Uncertainty estimates were based on analysis of data from aircraft emissions measurement campaigns and analyses of aircraft operations. The First-Order Approximation (FOA3) – currently the standard approach used to estimate particulate matter emissions from aircraft – is compared to measurements and it is shown that there are discrepancies greater than an order of magnitude for 40\% of cases for both organic carbon and black carbon emissions indices. Modified methods to approximate organic carbon emissions, arising from incomplete combustion and lubrication oil, and black carbon are proposed. These alterations lead to factor 8 and a 44\% increase in the annual emissions estimates of black and organic carbon particulate matter, respectively, leading to a factor 3.4 increase in total PM2.5 emissions compared to the current FOA3 methodology. Our~estimates of emissions are used in Part II to quantify the air quality and health impacts of UK airports, to assess mitigation options, and to estimate the impacts of a potential London airport expansion.},

  abstract = {Aircraft black carbon (BC) emissions contribute to climate forcing, but few estimates of BC emitted by aircraft at cruise exist. For the majority of aircraft engines the only BC-related measurement available is smoke number (SN)—a filter based optical method designed to measure near-ground plume visibility, not mass. While the first order approximation (FOA3) technique has been developed to estimate BC mass emissions normalized by fuel burn [EI(BC)] from SN, it is shown that it underestimates EI(BC) by {$>$}90\% in 35\% of directly measured cases (R2 = −0.10). As there are no plans to measure BC emissions from all existing certified engines—which will be in service for several decades—it is necessary to estimate EI(BC) for existing aircraft on the ground and at cruise. An alternative method, called FOX, that is independent of the SN is developed to estimate BC emissions. Estimates of EI(BC) at ground level are significantly improved (R2 = 0.68), whereas estimates at cruise are within 30\% of measurements. Implementing this approach for global civil aviation estimated aircraft BC emissions are revised upward by a factor of ∼3. Direct radiative forcing (RF) due to aviation BC emissions is estimated to be ∼9.5 mW/m2, equivalent to ∼1/3 of the current RF due to aviation CO2 emissions.}

The new classifications are based on vehicle weight and fuel used (i.e., gasoline or diesel). The heavier vehicles have higher emissions, so it is important to use correct vehicle weight distributions. Tennessee’s HDV registration data show a distribution very similar to the national defaults, but with more vehicles in the heaviest weight category (HDV8B). More than 50\% of Tennessee’s HDVs fall in the lightest vehicle category (HDV2B). The biggest difference in truck characteristics in Tennessee versus national defaults in MOBILE6 is the higher HDV fraction on Tennessee rural Interstates. Also, the ratio of single-unit trucks to trailer trucks varies considerably by facility type. The emissions of volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide per mile of travel of gasoline-fueled single-unit trucks can be 2.5 to 5 times higher than those of heavy-duty diesel trailer trucks. The emissions of nitrogen oxides per mile of travel of diesel-fueled tractor–trailer trucks can be five times higher than those of gasoline-fueled single-unit trucks. For these reasons  it is important to accurately characterize the HDV fleet. The characteristics of the Tennessee HDV fleet are compared with national defaults used in MOBILE6, and a new scheme for classifying vehicles by road type is presented.}

  abstract = {The Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) provide local labor market statistics by industry, worker demographics, employer age and size. Unlike statistics tabulated from firm or person-level data, the QWI source data are unique job-level data that link workers to their employers. Because of this link, labor market data in the QWI is available by worker age, sex, educational attainment, and race/ethnicity. This allows for analysis by demographics of a particular local labor market or industry – for instance, identifying industries with aging workforces. Links between workers and firms also allow the QWI to identify worker flows – hires, separations, and turnover – as well as net employment growth. As most hiring activity is the consequence of worker turnover rather than employment growth, a focus on employment growth alone may misrepresent employment opportunity in the local labor market. Wages by industry and demographics as well as by whether the worker was newly hired are also available. QWI wages for new hires can be compared to wages for continuing workers, and wage growth for similar workers across industries can be compared to identify important local labor market trends.  The source data for the QWI is the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) linked employeremployee microdata.  The LEHD data is massive longitudinal database covering over 95\% of U.S. private sector jobs. Much of this data is  collected via a unique federal-state data sharing collaboration, the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) partnership. LED is a cooperative venture between the LEHD program at the U.S. Census Bureau and state agencies of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands2. Partner states voluntarily submit quarterly data files from existing administrative record systems, which are combined with a range of other data sources to generate public use products, including QWI and LODES (LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics, presented in OnTheMap) and other new products in development. By integrating data used to administer public programs with existing census and surveys, a new national jobs database is generated at very low cost and with no additional respondent burden.},

Here, the development of the Aircraft Performance Model Implementation (APMI) software which is used to update global commercial aviation fuel burn and emissions estimates is described. The results from APMI are compared with published estimates obtained using the US Federal Aviation Administration’s System for Assessing Aviation’s Global Emissions (SAGE) for the year 2006. The number of global departures modelled with the APMI software is 8\% lower compared with SAGE and reflects the difference between their commercial air traffic statistics data sources. The mission fuel burn, CO2 and H2O estimates from APMI are approximately 20\% lower than those predicted by SAGE for 2006 while the estimate for the total global aircraft SOx emissions is approximately 40\% lower. The estimates for the emissions of CO, HC and NOx are 10\%, 140\% and 30\% higher than those predicted by SAGE respectively. The reasons for these differences are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {There are over 1,000 bus transit systems in the United States. Approximately two-thirds of the transit bus fleet is diesel-fueled, one-fifth is fueled by natural gas and the remainder is mostly diesel hybrid-electric. The objective of this research is to quantify and compare the fuel economy of transit buses based on fuel, power train, and bus size. The scope includes Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and diesel fueled buses with conventional power trains and hybrid diesel. This work addresses common transit bus sizes, including 30-foot, 40-foot, and 60-foot long buses. Empirical data for measured cycle-average fuel economy and emission rates for these buses were obtained from the Integrated Bus Information System (IBIS). IBIS data are based on chassis dynamometer measurements for selected driving cycles. Fuel use and emission rates for transit buses can be estimated using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's MOVES2014 model. However, MOVES does not estimate rates for specific bus sizes or for hybrids. North Carolina State University (NCSU) has developed a simplified version of MOVES, referred to as MOVES Lite, that can be coupled with a traffic simulation model to estimate regional transportation energy use and emissions. Here, the focus is on comparing empirical chassis dynamometer data with predictions of MOVES Lite to develop simplified models. These models are used for predicting energy use rates for transit bus fuels, power trains, and sizes not represented in MOVES. Trends in fuel use with respect to cycle average speed based on chassis dynamometer data are compared with those estimated using MOVES Lite. Adjustment factors were developed to adjust MOVES Lite estimates for generic transit buses to represent 30-, 40-, and 60-foot long CNG and diesel buses and 40-and 60-foot long diesel-hybrid buses. Fuel economy is higher for smaller buses and for diesel hybrid-electric versus diesel versus CNG. The simplified models will be implemented in MOVES Lite to estimate energy use and emission rates for transit bus fleets in major metropolitan areas.},

  abstract = {With the expected rapid growth of renewable electricity generation, charging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) from the grid promise ever higher reductions in CO2 emissions. Previous analyses have found that the share that PHEVs are driven in electric mode can differ substantially depending on region, battery size, and trip purpose. Here, we provide a first fleet-wide emissions mitigation potential of US-based PHEV drivers adopting high or low shares of electric driving. Specifically, we illustrate scenarios of different combinations of PHEV uptake, renewable electricity generation shares, and PHEV fueling behavior. Across 21 analyzed scenarios, annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet could differ by an average of 21\% (5–43\% range) in 2050 depending alone on the fueling behavior of PHEV drivers. This behavior could further determine the discharge of about 1.3 (0.7–1.9) Gt CO2 (or roughly one year of current emissions) over the next three decades, significantly influencing the feasibility of reaching an 80\% emission reduction target for the LDV sector. Governments can nudge PHEV drivers toward environmentally favorable fueling behavior. We discuss several options for nudging, including charging infrastructure availability, battery design, and consumer education.},

  abstract = {Hybrid and electric powertrains and alternative fuels (e.g., compressed natural gas (CNG), biodiesel, or hydrogen) can often reduce energy consumption and emissions from transit bus operations relative to conventional diesel. However, the magnitude of these energy and emissions savings can vary significantly, due to local conditions and transit operating characteristics. This paper introduces the transit Fuel and Emissions Calculator (FEC), a mode-based life-cycle emissions modeling tool for transit bus and rail technologies that compares the performance of multiple alternative fuels and powertrains across a range of operational characteristics and conditions. The purpose of the FEC is to provide a practical, yet technically sophisticated tool for regulatory agencies and policy analysts in assessing transit fleet options. The FEC’s modal modeling approach estimates emissions as a function of engine load, which in turn is a function of transit service parameters, including duty cycle (idling and speed-acceleration profile), road grade, and passenger loading. This approach allows for customized assessments that account for local conditions. Direct emissions estimates are derived from the scaled tractive power (STP) operating mode bins and emissions factors employed in the U.S. EPA’s MOVES (MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator) model. Life-cycle emissions estimates are calculated using emissions factors from the GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) model. The case study presented in this paper applies the FEC to second-by-second GPS position data collected from buses operating in metropolitan Atlanta, GA. These operations, from two different transit agencies, feature distinctly different transit service types: local transit bus operations and longer-distance express bus operations. The results illustrate that the decision as to which bus technology-fuel combination produces the least greenhouse gas emissions is a function of location and route characteristics. For the express bus operations monitored, the case study shows that CNG vehicles offer greater emissions reductions than Biodiesel (B20). For local bus services, battery electric buses show the greatest emissions savings in the fuel cycle, as long as range limitations can be met for the specific routes. The amount of these emissions savings is, however, highly dependent on the power generation mix. Among CNG, B20, parallel hybrid, series hybrid, and fuel cell buses, the least emitting option varies by location, due to complex interactions of factors such as duty cycle, meteorology, and terrain.},

  abstract = {This article presents a model of the environmental assessment of the system of wastewater collection, transport and treatment. The model was developed based on an original environmental assessment method of a system consisting of four elements: septic tanks, household wastewater treatment plants, a sewerage system and a central wastewater treatment plant. To conduct the environmental assessment, the Life Cycle Assessment technique was applied. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method was also applied, which enabled the determination of the carbon footprint of the analysed wastewater management system. This article presents the outline of an original method applied to create a model and an inventory of the data necessary for environmental assessment and the application of the model for the environmental assessment of a system of wastewater collection, transport and treatment in a city with over 50.000 inhabitants. Three feasible variants (from a functional, technical, organizational and financial point of view) of the system’s development were analysed. The variants were subjected to comparative analysis using the solution. The obtained results, together with the assessment method can be used as a practical tool to assess whether the European Commission’s guidelines are met, as well as the challenges facing wastewater management in the circular economy are overcome.},

This study presents a singular spectrum analysis (SSA) as a univariate time-series model and vector autoregressive model (VAR) as a multivariate model. Empirical results suggest that SSA satisfactorily indicates the evolving trend and provides reasonable results. The VAR model, which comprised exogenous parameters related to the market on a monthly basis, can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. The EV sales in China, which are categorized into battery and plug-in EVs, are predicted in both short term (up to December 2017) and long term (up to 2020), as statistical proofs of the growth of the Chinese EV industry.},

The energy consumption simulation and life cycle emissions for the trucks are based on payload, temperature and two drive cycles in Toronto. The energy consumption simulations are performed using Autonomie, a simulation software. The simulation data are used in GHGenius to calculate the life cycle GHG emissions. The cost of GHG emissions abatement for each alternative fuel truck is determined based on the differences in cost and GHG emissions between the alternative trucks and the diesel (reference) truck. The results of the analyses indicate that there is no dominant technology that reduces both GHG emissions and ownership cost under all driving conditions, a conclusion that can inform transportation climate change policies.},

  abstract = {Real time number concentrations and size distributions of ultrafine particles (UFPs, diameter {$<$}100~nm) and time integrated black carbon, PM2.5 mass, and chemical species were studied at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and a background reference site. At LAX, data were collected at the blast fence (∼140~m from the takeoff position) and five downwind sites up to 600~m from the takeoff runway and upwind of the 405 freeway. Size distributions of UFPs collected at the blast fence site showed very high number concentrations, with the highest numbers found at a particle size of approximately 14~nm. The highest spikes in the time series profile of UFP number concentrations were correlated with individual aircraft takeoff. Measurements indicate a more than 100-fold difference in particle number concentrations between the highest spikes during takeoffs and the lowest concentrations when no takeoff is occurring. Total UFP counts exceeded 107~particles~cm−3 during some monitored takeoffs. Time averaged concentrations of PM2.5 mass and two carbonyl compounds, formaldehyde and acrolein, were statistically elevated at the airport site relative to a background reference site. Peaks of 15~nm particles, associated with aircraft takeoffs, that occurred at the blast fence were matched with peaks observed 600~m downwind, with time lags of less than 1~min. The results of this study demonstrate that commercial aircraft at LAX emit large quantities of UFP at the lower end of currently measurable particle size ranges. The observed highly elevated UFP concentrations downwind of LAX associated with aircraft takeoff activities have significant exposure and possible health implications.},
